# Why should twitter users consider Twindle to read through Twitter thread?

Before we dive into what Twindle aims to solve and why to consider Twindle as the first set of choices to read through informative threads on Twitter, let's take a look at the existing problem in reading through or following a long thread on Twitter.

### The Problem

Twitter threads are a common way, nowadays, to share informative content about diverse subjects quickly instead of writing up a blog post on Medium or a personal website. On every clock tick, the twitter feed volume grows exponentially; thus, keeping tracking of the threads that users find useful has become a painstaking process;

### Existing Solutions

Widely used approaches are to track is to retweet, like the tweet revisit later by scrolling through your likes feed. 

Alternatively, a Twitter bot named threadreaderapp was introduced to address the pain point by allowing users to retweet on the original post and get a link that combines all the information related to the thread in one place through a URL. Non-twitter users can also access the URL.

### Limitations of threadreaderapp

Although the threadreaderapp alleviates the pain point, there are some limitations in using the threadreaderapp bot as follows.
    - If the thread owner blocks the threadreaderapp bot, it will not access the thread content.
    - If the thread owner is a private user, the bot will not access the thread content.
    - The threadreaderapp bot can only access up to 3000 tweets per user
    - Threads get deleted from the app when they are deleted by the author or Twitter because the app site is in sync with Twitter. The only way to avoid this is a premium membership which allows threads to be saved as PDF files.
    - Finally, the reader must connect to the internet to access the URL
    
### Twindle: Access thread content offline as well
In walks Twindle, a web application allows users to convert threads on Twitter to pdf or ePub format. 
    - The users can store the pdf/ePub on a digital device 
    - The users can store the pdf/ePub on cloud services i.e, Dropbox, Google Drive and access offline,
    - Otherwise, print a hard copy and read like a good-old-traditional-reader.
