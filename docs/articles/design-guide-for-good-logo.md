There are some teams and logos you see, no matter where you are in the world, and you know exactly who they are and what they mean.

## Hi everyone, this is Vipin, a frontend dev from Punjab, India with good knowledge of design and UI/UX.

Twindle has got a lot of overwhelming response from the dev community and and begginers have also flooded their ideas for branding and logos.


As we are designing a logo, some things should be taken in my mind (of course there is no hard and fast rule ðŸ˜…)

# 1. LOGO DESIGN MUST REFLECT YOUR BUSINESS

Your logo needs to help your business stand out in a crowd, but in a way where the person looking at it can easily identify that it is your unique company. If you can incorporate into the logo key elements that your business represents, you have a better chance of people remembering it. 

# 2. KEEP IT SIMPLE 

Stop with all that clutter. Trying to squeeze too much into a logo can have a negative impact.

# 3. MAKE A STATEMENT IN BLACK & WHITE AND COLOUR

Make certain that your logo works well - both in colour and in black and white. 

If the logo loses impact in black and white, it is going to be a problem when you have to print in newspapers or utilise services that only use black ink. Ensure that a colourful logo design translates well visually into black & white.

# 4. A SCALABLE SOLUTION

our logo has to be scalable to be effective. 

Your logo might look great on your letterhead, but what happens when you have to reduce the size for a business card or online forum? The rule of thumb when it comes to scalable logos, is that your logo should look good - whether on a business card or a billboard. If you can accomplish that, you have a great logo design.

# 5. KEEP IT BALANCED

Your logo should be designed to stand the test of time too. Ensure that your design does not make overt use of fashion trends - or you may find your logo is quickly dated. 

Once you have decided what logo is perfect for your business, be sure to have it converted in JPG, GIF, and EPS format. This way you can easily use the logo for your printed materials and website.

Once you have all these key elements in place, we come to the most important part of a successful logo design and brand statement.

Now that you have your logo, and it has been broadcast to the world, it is vital you always use your logo in a consistent manner. 

Don't alter your logo for certain flyers or brochures. Not only will this confuse your audience, it risks looking less than professional. You can reduce and enlarge the logo for different formats, but never change the essence of the design.
