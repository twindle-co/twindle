Titi Olopade from United Kingdom. My background is computing with few years career break.
I came back and got PRINCE2 certification (project management) and started learning coding less than a year ago.
My HTML and CSS are at an intermediate level. 
Here is how I created my second PR.
Use GIT Bash for Microsoft Windows environment to run GIT from my commandline.
From the twindle repository page on GitHub, click the green button labeled Clone or download.
In the “Clone with HTTPs” section, copy the URL for the repository.
On your laptop, open your GIT bash shell.
Type 'cd desktop' to change to to desktop directory where you want to install the cloned repository
Next, type 'git clone (URL for the repository)'
Once completed, it will display 'done'
Type 'ls -a' to view all the files in the repository (Do not edit any file from the command line).
Now go back and make some changes and save.
Then commit on your laptop by typing 'git commit'
Then push to your fork and then on your fork you make pull request, just like for 1st PR.
