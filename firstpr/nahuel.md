Hi everyone! I am Nahuel from Argentina, I am 24 years old. 
I am a beginner and this is my first time working in a project and using GitHub, have basic knowledge of c++, c #, html5, css and javascript.
I apologize if my english is not very good, I will do my best to help.
this will help me practice the language.

I modified this from my local repo! so this will be the 2nd PR

Thanks for the opportunity!
